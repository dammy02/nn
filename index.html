 <li>Brookhaven on Roblox game has the potential for kids to see a lot of inappropriate content.17 Mar 2023</li>
 <li>While kids far younger than 13 will want to play, given the Roblox platform's continuing challenges with problematic content, it's strongly recommended against unsupervised play for kids under that age.</li>
 <li>What is Brookhaven? With over 20 billion visits, Brookhaven is one of the most popular titles on the Roblox platform. In terms of gameplay, it's essentially a lifestyle simulator with a school to attend, jobs to work, cars to drive, and plenty of fellow Robloxians to meet.</li>

  <li>Intruder IS the definition of "a scary Roblox game" when you don't look into it beforehand. DOORS is scary for the first jumpscare of each entity, then gets repetitive. EVADE is a fun game but it's only thing close to horror is it being VERY stressful.</li>
  <li>Roblox's Survive the Killer is a perfect alternative to the classic Hide and Seek. The central point of the game is to hide from the killer, help teammates and try to escape together. Survive the Killer has various premium items that can be unlocked while playing the game.</li>
  <li>There are two Endings for Metro 2033, two endings for Metro: Last Light, and two endings for Metro Exodus, both based on the moral choices that the player makes throughout the game.</li>
